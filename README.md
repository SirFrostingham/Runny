“RUNNY” – WINDOWS APP SCHEDULE AUTOMATION TOOL
 – Basically, this is an alternative to Windows Task Scheduler
This is a very simple, light weight, straightforward, alternative to Windows Task Scheduler.
 - I use it for automating things on the fly and quickly
 

Who is this for?
 - This is the perfect tool for a Windows system administrator, a game server owner, or a tinkerer of any kind.
 

Why use this over Window task scheduler?
 - This application always rubs at the Administrator level.
 - This tool works around complexities and UI from Microsoft Task Scheduler.
 

Compatible:
 - Tested on Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10
 - May work on other versions, but must make sure .Net 4.5 is installed.
 

Features:

    - NOTE: No need to update this application once it is running.  Updates to scheduler.xml are processed instantly.
	– Run any command/batch script, program, program shortcut, or executable
	– No app “updater” callbacks to a server to for app version updates
	– App runs as an application, not a service
	– Small memory footprint (around 26 KB)
	– App runs as system administrator
	– Easily configure app easily with XML config file
	– Config file updates are picked up without restarting the application
    
	– Per XML job, set:

		– start date – start a command at a future date (Month/Day/Year): 01/01/2015
		– end date – run command to expiration date (Month/Day/Year): 01/01/2012
		– time – format: hour:minute:second (example midnight/12am: 00:00:00)
		– day – 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (aka: Sun,Mon,Tues,Wed,Thurs,Fri,Sat)
		– loop – 1 = on, 0 = off, default = 1
		– command – command to run, example: start “” “c:\test.cmd”
		– commandparams – for if separating out command parameters
